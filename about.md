> LinkedChain aims to revolutionize the hiring process.

**LinkedChain** makes the employee experience storage and verification more secure and efficient, and provides a new mechanism of hiring new candidates. We are a team of four MS CS graduate students (Naveen Kanuri, Aditya Parab, Abhishek Gokhale, and Maanas Vohra) attending the ECS 265 Distributed Database Systems and we will present LinkedChain as our project.
