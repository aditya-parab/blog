This is an installment of the ECS 265 Project Blog on **LinkedChain**. LinkedChain makes the employee experience storage and verification more secure and efficient, and provides a new mechanism of hiring new candidates. We are a team of four MS CS graduate students (Naveen Kanuri, Aditya Parab, Abhishek Gokhale, and Maanas Vohra) attending the ECS 265 Distributed Database Systems and we will present LinkedChain as our project.

## Future Work
We aim to improve the current product by implementing more features in the future, such as:

 - Send status updates by email or push notification to subscribed users
 - Automatically import data from LinkedIn and send work history requests to Employers
 - Add more UI elements (e.g. loading screen, add more user interaction etc.)
